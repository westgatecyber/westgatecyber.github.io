			<h3>Public key exchange</h3>
			
			<p>We have developed a novel certificate-based method of mutual authentication using public key infrastructure (PKI) concepts, and combined it with modern peer-to-peer networking to significantly reduce the friction of deploying secure communication channels between users and systems.</p>
			
			<p>Our exact method of key exchange is currently under NDA, if you would like you know more please <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.</p>
			
			<h3>Cryptography</h3>
		
			<p></p>
		
			<ul>
			
				<li>
					Elliptic curve cryptography for key exchange and key signing
					<p>We use ECDHE cryptography with Curve25519 to exchange keys, and Ed25519 to sign messages. We use the libsodium implementation of NaCl.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					AES message encryption
					<p>For symmetric encryption we use AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512 mode with PKCS#7 padding.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					We Encrypt-then-MAC
					<p>Using HMACSHA512 on AES256 in AEAD mode.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					We implement perfect forward secrecy
					<p>Long term keys for authentication, short term ephemeral keys for each new session.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					All comparisons are performed in constant-time
					<p>Removes an entire class of side-channel attacks.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					No support for data compression
					<p>Compression can leak information about the plaintext through side-channel attacks.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Invalid packets are dropped, and do not elicit error messages as part of the protocol specification
					<p>Reduces the risk of successful padding oracle attacks.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Session resuming is not permitted, nor part of the protocol
					<p>Minimises the attack surface of the protocol to renegotiation attacks.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Key rotation is forced after every 2<sup>^32</sup> bytes of data exchanged between peers
					<p>Well below the recommended key refresh boundary for AES256 (2<sup>^64</sup>).</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					A narrower public key infrastructure
					<p>Instant VPN operates with a single CA at any given point in time. In traditional TLS any of 600+ vendors can issue a certificate against your public key. In our PKI model, only one CA is active at any point in time, therefore reducing the risk of an obscure CA you've never heard of being compromised or going rogue and exposing you to man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>

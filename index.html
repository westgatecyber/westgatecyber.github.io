		<h2>About</h2>
		
		<p>Westgate Cyber Security is a UK-based company engaged in the <a href="/technology">research and development of new computer security technologies</a>, and <a href="/services">board-level cyber security risk awareness training</a>.</p>
		
		<hr />
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h2>Research</h2>
		
		<p>Our <a href="#">ElasticSockets</a> communication protocol is a new, and patent-pending technology which allows parties who share minimal knowledge of one another to quickly and securely establish zero configuration, mutually-authenticated and direct communication channels, requiring no technical knowledge of cryptography or complex supporting infrastructure.</p>

		<p>The ElasticSockets architecture is a combination of our novel method of authentication, with peer-to-peer networking capabilities into a product which overcomes common obstacles to establishing direct connections on the internet such as NAT traversal and abstracts the complexity of public key exchange from the end user allowing multiple parties to form dynamic, but secure communication enclaves and communities of interest.</p>
		
		<p>We achieve this without significant infrastructure to support to the communication, or complexity for the end-user. These qualities mean our method is particularly suited to deployment in unpredictable scenarios where flexible, but robust and highly secure communication channels are required at short notice.</p>
		
		<p>From enabling co-operative communication in Government, legal or commercial sectors, to lashing together coalition forces, disaster relief agencies or computer networks into short lived and highly secure enclaves for task or project-specific operations; The opportunities and use cases for secure, instant-on, easy to use and simple to deploy digital communications are extensive.</p>
		
		<p>Please see our <a href="/technology">technology</a> page for more information about ElasticSockets.<p>

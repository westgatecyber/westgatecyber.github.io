		<h2>About</h2>
		
		<p>Westgate Cyber Security is a UK-based company engaged in the <a href="/technology">research and development of new computer security technologies</a>, and <a href="/services">board-level cyber security risk awareness training</a>.</p>

		<h2>Research</h2>
		
		<p>Our <a href="/technology">ElasticSockets</a> communication protocol is a patent-application backed communications technology which allows parties sharing only minimal knowledge of one another to rapidly establish mutually-authenticated, secure and directly connected communication channels.</p>

		<p class="text-center">

			</div>
		</p>
		
		<p>The ElasticSockets architecture combines our novel method of authentication with peer-to-peer networks to fully abstract end-users from the complexity of public key exchange, and common obstacles to establishing direct connectivity such as NAT traversal.</p>
		
		<p>ElasticSockets makes it easy for developers to create software in which users and systems can freely form transient, secure, and directly communities of interest with minimal friction - qualities particularly suited to deployment in unpredictable scenarios where flexible, but robust and highly secure communication channels are required at short notice.</p>
		
		<p>From enabling co-operative communication in Government, legal or commercial sectors, to lashing together coalition forces, disaster relief agencies or computer networks into short lived and highly secure enclaves for task or project-specific operations; The opportunities and use cases for secure, instant-on, easy to use and simple to deploy digital communications are extensive.</p>
		
		<p>Please see our <a href="/technology">technology</a> page for more information about ElasticSockets.<p>

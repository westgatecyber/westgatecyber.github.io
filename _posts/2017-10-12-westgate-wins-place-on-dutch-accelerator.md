We’re extremely proud to announce that we’ve been offered a place on the Dutch [FinTech & CyberSecurity 2018](sbc) program run by Startupbootcamp! In fact we came top of a 500+ Global application and selection process.

Starting in November, we'll be spending the next 3 months in the beautiful city of Amsterdam on an intense, three month program.

Since we started working on Enclave, our vision has been to bring security, privacy and convenience to network operators world-wide. With Startupbootcamp’s guidance, expertise and market exposure, we’re a step closer on that journey.

With programs in London, New York, Singapore, Berlin and Amsterdam, Startupbootcamp has one goal: to help ambitious early-stage tech founders shake-up industries. They offer promising startups like Westgate a world-class accelerator program, and access to their global network.

The selection process was a gruelling 2-day event, pitching to 100+ mentors, industry experts and thought leaders. All we can say is that we're thoroughly exhausted, but extremely excited to be on board and looking forward to the next 3 months.

							<h2>Traditional VPN</h2>
							<p>Today our VPNs run on centralised infrastructure; deployed, powered and cooled. They are complicated to configure and time intensive to set up, fraught with overlapping standards and old encryption. Even when up and running they remain inflexible and resistant to change. It’s time to re-imagine VPN.</p>

			<h1>Summary</h1>
		
			<p>Instant VPN can stand up secure, mutually authenticated communications channels in seconds between users with limited technical knowledge, who don't necessarily share a common infrastructure, or even fully trust one another.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Easily create secure VPN enclaves between individuals or organisations.</li>
				<li>No complex infrastructure required to connect users or systems.</li>
				<li>Instantly set up and tear down encrypted networks.</li>
				<li>Zero-configuration, and no technical knowledge required to deploy at either end.</li>
				<li>Our core technologies are available as embeddable libraries for integration into 3rd party systems.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>A novel approach to exchanging public keys</h3>
			
			<p>We have developed a novel certificate-based method of mutual authentication using public key infrastructure concepts, and combined it with modern peer-to-peer networking to significantly reduce the friction of deploying secure communication channels between users and systems.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Certificates are issued in real-time to endpoints.</li>
				<li>No technical knowledge is required to obtain a certificate.</li>
				<li>Certificates can be installed to the operating system, or physically protected in hardware security modules.</li>
				<li>Certificates are used for mutual client-authentication between all parties.</li>
			</ul>

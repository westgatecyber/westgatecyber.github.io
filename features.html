			<h3>Features</h3>
		
			<p>Instant VPN can stand up secure, mutually authenticated communications channels in seconds between users with limited technical knowledge, who don't necessarily share a common infrastructure, or even fully trust one another.</p>
			
			<p>This partitioned trust model has extensive use-cases from communication between humans to desktop and mobile devices, constrained systems and sensors in the internet of things.</p>
			
			<ul>
			
				<li>
					Encrypted communications platform
					<p>Instantly-deployable private communications platform. Create secure virtual private networks without centralised infrastructure.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Low friction use
					<p>Mutual authentication with a novel twist makes for extremely quick connection setup times.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Instantly set up and tear down encrypted networks
					<p>Our platform is designed to provide ad-hoc and secure private networks that are quick to create, destroy and reconfigure. No technical knowledge is required to create secure connections, and it can be setup with ease, without an IT department and complex configuration.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Strong authentication and encryption
					<p>Connections are established using mutual authentication, and perfect forward secrecy provides long term privacy and resistance to brute force attacks on any recorded session data. All endpoints physically own their private keys and certificates used during mutual authentication, so digital identities can be protected by the local operating system, or securely stored in air-gapped hardware for higher assurance.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Peer-to-peer full mesh connectivity
					<p>Connections between users are peer-to-peer, so there are no centralised servers to power, cool or maintain for end-users.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Create ad-hoc networks in a flash
					<p>Instant VPN works especially well for users or teams that don’t share any common IT infrastructure, or even fully trust one another but still need to share information securely.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Full control
					<p>Users decide with whom they connect, and what they share. Enterprise administrators can centrally control fleets of endpoints.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Developer Friendly
					<p>Our platform exposes an API-driven control plane which allows third party developers to build on top of our secure, decentralised communications platform to create a rich ecosystem of collaborative applications.</p>
				</li>
				
			</ul>

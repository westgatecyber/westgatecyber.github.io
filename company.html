            <p>Incorporated in 2012 as a cyber security consultancy, Westgate sought to raise board-level security risk awareness.</p>
            <p>Recognising a growing industry need for software that is both secure and user friendly, in late 2015 we changed direction. With support from Innovate UK and Airbus we started work on our first commercial product, Enclave - a secure overlay network with an extreme focus on usability and convenience.</p>

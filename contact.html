			<h3>About</h3>
			
			<p>Decentralised communication on the internet is difficult. Westgate Cyber Security are building an alternative to the prevailing client-to-server communications model.</p>

			<p>Today, users and systems move data to one another using well known, centralised servers as pit-stops and meeting points for their data. Even when direct communication would be more appropriate, these bottlenecks in the network are often still used simply because the tools to connect endpoints together securely and directly are hard to build.</p>

			<p>In 1977 when IPv4 was first conceived the internet didn’t look like this. Nearly every connected device was directly accessible, but by the early 1990s it had grown beyond anybody’s expectations and IP address exhaustion was fast becoming a recognisable problem among engineers. The development of network address translation (NAT) soon followed, a necessary evil which continues to cripple communication between endpoints today by hiding many devices behind a single, publically routable internet address.</p>

			<p>The NAT mind-set influenced the design of many early protocols, and became the standard model for communication between endpoints through well-known, centralised servers. Today the client-server model dominates the technology industry leading to many unresolved questions surrounding the efficacy, privacy and security of the cloud-connected world.</p>

			<p>One of the major challenges of real-time and direct client-to-client communication is the problem of mutual authentication.</p>

			<p>TLS, for example, is one of the most widely deployed protocols in the world, yet protocol-level authentication usually remains one-sided. The server is often the only party in possession of a certificate - something which can be difficult to obtain if you do not own a name registered in public DNS.</p>

			<p>Because of this, mutual authentication is comparatively rare, and server operators usually find other ways to identify client connections. Poor implementations of username and password storage, and use of pre-shared secrets that don't change are common.</p>
			
			<p>The elephant in the room is almost always low-friction, robust authentication for the end-user.</p>

			<blockquote>How can endpoints and users exchange public keys, confidant that those keys weren’t manipulated during the exchange without subscribing to a costly, or complex trust hierarchy?</blockquote>

			<p>Beyond the problem of trust, too often we see protocols built to satisfy everyone, everywhere – sometimes designers are forced to pick between interoperability and security. Sometimes protocol designers try to accommodate too many use-cases and their protocols become contrived. Sometimes protocols are just complicated and hard to implement – all of which are characteristics that have been shown time and time again to be seriously detrimental to the security of interconnected systems.</p>

			<p>To address some of these challenges, we have engineered a novel yet extremely simple technique for issuing certificates and exchanging public keys between end-users and systems.</p>

			<p>We have constrained our view of the problem to secure, client-to-client communications between users and systems which have a natural, and real-world relationship to one another. By doing so we have engineered a more focused solution to the problem than we believe exists today.</p>

			<p>Our novel method of issuing certificates in real-time, and the peer-to-peer networking concepts underpinning Instant VPN are packaged as embeddable libraries. By building on top of these libraries,  developers have access to the tools and abstractions they need to link software in fully connected peer-to-peer meshes, using state of the art encryption and mutual authentication.</p>

			<p>In short, we’re building the tools developers are using to re-connect the internet.</p>
